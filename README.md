Workspaces for [Ramen](https://github.com/RogerLevy/ramen)

Version 1 - dev GUI toolkit

you can create dynamic interfaces that can be used within the Ramen environment.

status:

currently just labels and buttons

roadmap:

- version 2 will have multiple workspaces, the ability to save and load your session plus individual interfaces (called Figures), and the ability to use them as a data storage format
- version 3 will be a self-contained Forth system with a specialized code editor that stores code in a figure-based format.
